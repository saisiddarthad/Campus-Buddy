# Campus Buddy

This app will help students keep up with events on campus by viewing a map of Virginia Tech showing relevant details such as parking information, club events, construction blockages, and dining hall availability. This is all achieved through crowdsourcing features that allow users to place icons and contribute specific information to improve the experience of other users of the app.
